    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>The overall project plan (to be completed in 3 phases) is to control an elevator, leveraging the use of a CAN bus communications environment, coupled with networked systems to create a means of tracking the elevator’s operational/diagnostics data. The elevator car’s position and status must also be viewable to computers over the Internet.</p>
    <p>Our names are Joshua B. Perry, Ryan J. M. Furry, and Robert R. Pierce</p>
